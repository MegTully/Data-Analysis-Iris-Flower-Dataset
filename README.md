This Project is based off a dataset created by R.A Fisher which contains information about three types of iris plants. There are 4 attributes used to differentiate each plant class, they are petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width. The three iris flower types are iris setosa, iris versicolor and iris virginica[1].
