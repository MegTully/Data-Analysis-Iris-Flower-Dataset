# pands-project

This Project is based off a dataset created by R.A Fisher which contains information about three types of iris plants. There are 4 attributes used to differentiate each plant class, they are petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width. The three iris flower types are iris setosa, iris versicolor and iris virginica[1].

# Iris Dataset
The dataset was downloaded from the UCI website [1] and column headings were added to the .txt file in notepad ++. The dataset was then read into the analysis.py file to be analysed.
